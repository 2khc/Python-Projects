Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Club,Mytra Gallery,,,https://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/723155217697112/,10.00,"UCLU grappling trains in No-Gi grappling (without the traditional kimono) and utilises Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with coaches from the world famous Gracie Barra gym.  This martial art promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper technique, taking the fight to the ground and applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person. Training can be used for both competition and self-defence.  This martial art became known worldwide in 1993 when Royce Gracie used it to defeat a range of much larger martial artists in the first ever UFC event. This ‘no-holds barred’ competition was designed to settle the age old debate of “whose martial art works in a real fight?” Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu came out on top with very little competition.  The emphasis on ground fighting is what really sets us apart from other martial arts, as the legendary Carlos Machado once said “After the clinch, it doesn’t matter what happens, one way or another, we’re going to hit the ground, and we’ll be in my world. The ground is my ocean, I’m the shark, and most people don’t even know how to swim”.

Judo Club,,,,https://www.facebook.com/groups/6749478556/?fref=ts,10.00,"The UCLU Judo society is one of the oldest martial arts societies at UCL, and we have the privilege of being coached by Bane Andjelkovic (6th Dan). We are a very friendly and welcoming society open to people of all abilities; each year we have a substantial intake of people who have never trained before so don’t be shy, come along and try it, you won’t be alone! At the beginning of each year we run a two week trial period where people can come along to training and decide whether the sport is for them before making any financial commitments.  Judo is particularly good for overall body fitness as the motions required to complete the throws and ground work positions require multiple groups of muscles simultaneously, improving co-ordination and control. The result of mastering this is that size no longer matters; if the timing is right anyone should be able to throw anyone.  We are a very diverse society in terms of grade and age, with many former UCL students coming back to train with us. For those who wish to compete we also enter several major competitions a year, depending on demand. We have achieved great success in the past; we were 8th in the country and 2nd among the 13 London Universities in 2014.  We train 3 times a week in two hour sessions. Our training times are:  Tuesday 7.45-9.45pm (Bloomsbury Fitness Studio)  Wednesday 8-10pm (Astor College)  Sunday 5-6.45pm (Bloomsbury Fitness Studio)  We collaborate a lot with BJJ and members often cross train on Sunday’s as the BJJ training session runs from 3-5pm just before us.  Membership to UCLU Judo for the year is £10, and we have a monthly mat fee of £10 as well.  For anyone who has not trained before and doesn’t have a gi, wearing a long sleeved top and any free moving long trousers/leggings for the first session will be fine!

Events: We do talks with some of the best NGOs and experts within the field of asylum seekers and refugees and we always try to follow up with actual action in relation to the topic of the event. We have lots of feature film and documentary screenings planned for the year ahead! Also come along to our socials for a chance to meet like minded people and have a good time.  Campaigns: Last year, UCL STARs successfully ran the Equal Access campaign, meaning that people seeking refugee protection in the UK now only have to pay domestic fees to study at UCL, as opposed to the international fees which are often unaffordable to those who have fled their country. This year we will be continuing with this campaign to ensure UCL is providing funding to make sure there is no barrier to achieving a place at UCL. We will also be carrying on the Still Human Still Here campaign, which aims to end destitution and secure the right to work for asylum seekers, and the Campaign Against Detention , to end the destitution of asylum seekers. Let us know if you have any campaigning ideas you would like us to run on campus!  Volunteering: We will be working with STAR National and local community organisations and NGOs to create volunteering and internship opportunities for our members. Please email or send us a message on facebook for more information.   Our joining fee is £2 this year, the lowest fee you can get! ",

Socionics Society,William Skelton,,,https://www.facebook.com/groups/uclusocionicssociety,3.00,"Socionics is a theory of personality type that provides valuable insight into the functioning of the psyche. It is a 'philosophy of psychology', in the same way that Thomas Kuhn's concept of 'paradigm shift' is a theory in philosophy of science. Socionics was developed by Aushra Augusta, a Lithuanian psychologist, whose work incorporated Carl Jung’s Psychological Types with the psychological theory of so-called “information metabolism”. Among the basic concepts in Socionics is its model of information processing (known as Model A), which attempts to explain the fundamental differences in the way different people perceive and interact with the world. The model consists of eight Information Elements, or functions of the psyche, arranged in a specific order for each of the sixteen personality types, which determines the natural strengths and weaknesses of a particular type. Based on this, the theory also provides a model of intertype relations, predicting the dynamics of a relationship between two people of different personality types. Additionally, Socionics can be used as an analytical tool in various spheres of knowledge and areas of life. The theory would be of interest to both science and humanities-oriented students, specifically to those interested in psychology, neuroscience, sociology and philosophy.

Cycling Club,Finn Fitzgerald,uczxcyc@ucl.ac.uk,,http://www.facebook.com/groups/507442862672831/,5.00,"As a club we cater for cyclists of all types and abilities by offering a wide range of activities for every type of cyclist.  The club has a strong social cycling aspect ranging from short rides around London, to longer day trips out of London to places such as Cambridge, Oxford or Brighton. On top of this we are running social cycling tours at several points throughout the year. This coming year we can guarantee a social ride being led by a member of our committee once a fortnight, although once everyone gets to know each other, rides can also be organised on an ad hoc basis with other club members.  The club has a very committed racing team who will be training 2-3 times a week over the winter months. This training will be based around a combination of high intensity racing specific rides, and longer slower base mile rides. We have the option of racing almost year round with winter criterium series racing being an option, or for the tougher cyclists among us cyclocross being an option in the winter. The first BUCS (university) event is the hill climb at the end of October, there is also a BUCS cyclocross event before christmas too. April is when the time trialling season begins with several BUCS time trials to enter. The university season then finishes with the BUCS road race and crit race.  Excluding outdoor sessions we run spinning once a week, which we should be able to subsidise for some club members. Also we have the provisions to run turbo training sessions, where you can use your own bike and run more specific interval sessions, or just stationary cycling to avoid bad weather.  When bikes aren’t involved at all, we often have social events where we can get together in a non cycling context (although lycra is often still required!). We will be running one social a month, with more being likely to include such things as Critical mass.  For details of all events go to our facebook page, which is regularly updated.

Cricket Club (RUMS),James Groves,uczxcru@ucl.ac.uk,,https://www.facebook.com/groups/rumscricket/,25.00,"Successful on the field and inclusive and friendly off it, RUMS Cricket is a flourishing club which offers a fantastic university experience. We embrace both the playing and social aspects of the game and new members of all abilities are encouraged to join, whether a seasoned cricketer or a genuine beginner.  Our cricketing year begins by tracing the steps of the past and present greats of the game at “The Home of Cricket”, Lord’s Cricket Ground. Here we run net sessions throughout the first and second terms. In the summer, we field 1st and 2nd XI sides, who compete in LUSL and BUCS leagues and the famed UH Cup. Coming off the back of RUMS CC’s most successful season ‘since records began’, with the 1st XI bagging the UH T20 and UH Plate double, there’s never been a better time to play cricket for RUMS.  Boasting an increasingly vibrant social schedule, RUMS CC provides a warm and welcoming environment for getting to know fellow medics of all ages, and a useful network of support throughout the year. In addition to Sports Night on Wednesday evenings, we hold regular social events – with our Meet the Club Meal and Pub Golf just to name a couple. In fact, it is the club’s social prowess which continues to catch the eye of the great and good of the cricketing world, with a deal almost sealed to land a disgruntled Kevin Pietersen – said to be particularly enamored with RUMS CC’s policy of letting their players text message whatever they want.  Having toured Trinidad in 2013 and Singapore in 2015, RUMS Cricket continues to offer the unique and unforgettable experience of an International Tour. Unrivaled by any other club in RUMS, these tours offer the chance to play in a different climate, bring the team into a tight-knit group and are accessible for players of all levels of ability – all at an affordable price! This is truly an experience not to be missed.  So whether you’re looking for highly competitive university cricket, or just to meet some new people and have a laugh, RUMS CC is the club for you. We’d love to hear from you so for more information e-mail our President at vishal.rawji.11@ucl.ac.uk and be sure to follow our Twitter for updates on all things RUMS Cricket!  Full membership (£40) - This will include access to all Tuesday cricket nets during the year and match fees. Full members will also be eligible for match selection, both indoor and outdoor. Additionally, this membership will allow members to attend teaching during the year and eligibility to apply for the RUMS CC Research Studentships.
